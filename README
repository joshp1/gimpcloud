The intent of this app is to give a cross platform alternative to Adobe CC. It doesn't come with or work with photoshop. The intial intent is for it to work with Gimp on all platforms. 
I don't have a MAC so unless someone makes a interface on MAC there won't be one.
This application has four parts
